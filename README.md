How long did you spend on this assignment?
I spent about 4 hours on this assignment. Most of that time was spent understanding the algorithm and figuring out how to implement it efficiently in C++.
Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
I'd say I earned an A for effort.
Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
I believe my solution gets an A-. It correctly solves the problem and includes clear explanations, but there might be room for optimization.
Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
My solution works correctly, but I struggled a bit with printing the table in a neat format. I also wonder if there's a more efficient way to find the longest common substring without using a 2D vector. I attempted to solve it using dynamic programming, which worked well.
